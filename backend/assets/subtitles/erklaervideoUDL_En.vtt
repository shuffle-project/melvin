00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.800
This video is an introduction to
the Universal Design for Learning model.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:14.340
The acronym for this is "UDL."
We introduce basic principles and assumptions of the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.310
"UDL." For a complete presentation
the model is too complex.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.880
The "Universal Design for Learning" is based on
the "Universal Design" model.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:36.109
In German, this is called "Design für Alle".
"Universal Design" originally comes from

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:42.360
architecture. The goal in architecture is
the design of department stores and public

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.579
places so that as many people as possible can use them.
can use these places.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:55.960
Universal Design for Learning transfers this idea to curricula.
It is no longer about physically existing

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:08.820
places, but about learning, curricula, and learning content.
Curricula should support all learners in their learning process.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.860
Different learning processes of different
people already find consideration in the conception.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.670
Thus, individual adaptations are
rarely necessary afterwards.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.110
This also applies to media worlds: They should
accessible to all from the start.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.219
When we look at curricula with the "UDL" in mind, we pay attention to
to the following:

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:40.469
Where are barriers or problems to
learning?

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:49.000
Do different prerequisites find consideration?
Where are alternatives in the design of learning content?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.020
Next, we introduce the different
levels of Universal Design for Learning

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:07.039
based on CAST.
The model is presented as a table with three columns. Each column represents one level.

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:18.430
The first level is called learning engagement.
It is found in a green column.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.319
This level looks at WHY we learn.
It is concerned with the interest in learning and the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:30.910
motivation of the learner.
Media can do this, for example, through varied, interactive

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:39.349
elements. They are also based on experiences
from everyday life.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:48.190
The second level is called information. It is found in
a purple column.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.100
This level looks at WHAT we learn.
It is about representing and perceiving information. Media can

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:03.290
expand the choices of representation.
The third level is called information processing

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:12.830
and interaction with learning objects. It is
in a blue column.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.610
This level looks at HOW we learn. It is about,
interacting with learning objects and

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:27.200
Supporting the process of learning.
With the help of media, the ways of communicating and

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:37.319
the possibilities of creating transparency.
Now there are two ways to read the model's table.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.989
In option 1, the focus is on
a promotion of the three different

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.049
levels that we presented earlier in the three different
colors. We'll read each column,

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.980
each color, by itself and from top
to the bottom.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.239
In possibility 2 the focus is on
a learning process from the outside in.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:09.530
For this we read the table from left to
right. Thus, all three colored

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.819
levels are in view at the same time.
First we see the level of access.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:25.210
This is mainly about the exterior. How do I design,
for example, the learning environment, the learning content, or the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.900
the media used?
Then comes the level of development: How do learners stay

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:43.470
in the learning process? How do media support expression and communication?
At the bottom of the table is the level of internalization.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.700
So at the bottom is the internalization of learning.
This is about: How can learners...

00:04:50.700 --> 00:05:00.230
organize and structure their learning process independently
and structure it? How do media support comprehension?

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:11.320
Last is a summary. The goal is to develop learning experts.
Learning experts are learners who are able to implement

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.040
the "UDL" and possess the following characteristics
on the respective levels:

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:36.040
Learning experts are determined and motivated on the level of learning commitment.
Learning experts are resourceful and knowledgeable at the level of information.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.940
Learning experts are strategic and goal-oriented at the level of
Information Processing.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:49.910
In order to reach these learning experts we read
the table from the "UDL" always from the top to the bottom

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.910
and at the same time from left
to the right.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:07.660
Because: the upper levels are always prerequisite to reach the lower.
Example: If the learning environment is not designed in a meaningful and appealing way,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:17.910
learners do not learn to self-regulate the learning process.
That was a first glimpse into Universal Design for Learning.
